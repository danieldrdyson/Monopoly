# Monopoly
This is a recreation of the board game, Monopoly, using C# language. It uses the command prompt window to play the game. 2-8 players may play the game at a time, however it is played on one computer only (in other words, everyone shares the same computer).
Many of the functions of Monopoly are present in this recreation, however I feel that this project is unfinished and/or could use some major improvements.
